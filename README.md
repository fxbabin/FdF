# Fdf (Fil de Fer)

This project aims exploring infography with the basic concept of drawing lines. We have to create a program able to take maps formated as below 

<img src="imgs/file2.png" alt="drawing" width="800" />

## Basic output

<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/out1.png" alt="drawing" width="600" />
<p/>

## Output on dense maps

<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/out2.png" alt="drawing" width="500" />
<img src="imgs/out3.png" alt="drawing" width="500" />
<p/>

## Weird output

A mistake during the development lead to an "artistic bonus" where the lines of the map are incorectly rotated. It lead to weirdly beautiful outputs.
